<p>
The pi searcher uses a combination of two search techniques:
<i>Linear search</i> and <i>indexed search</i>.  We'll see why
in a few minutes.
</p>

<h2>Linear Search</h2>
<p>
Before Pi day 2006, this was the only way the pi searcher
operated.  The pi searcher has a file with the first 200M 
digits of pi.  When a visitor entered a search, the program 
would open the file and go through it digit by digit, comparing
them against the search string.
For example, if you
search for <tt>9265</tt>, the program would do the following:
</p>

<pre>Pi:      141592653589793238462643...
Query:   9265  (nope)

Pi:      141592653589793238462643...
Query:    9265 

Pi:      141592653589793238462643...
Query:     9265 

Pi:      141592653589793238462643...
Query:      9265 

Pi:      141592653589793238462643...
Query:       9265  (yep, it matches!) 
</pre>


<h2>Problem 1:  Pi is BIG!</h2>

<p>
For a computer, having a lot of Pi is like a human having a lot of
pie: It makes it fat and slow.  If you store Pi in a normal,
human-readable text file (like you can create in Notepad, Emacs, vi,
or whatever your favorite editor is), then Pi requires one byte per
digit.  So 200,000,000 digits of pi takes up 200,000,000 bytes, or 190
megabytes (computer scientists use the term megabyte to mean 2^20 bytes,
or 1048576, instead of just 1 million).  Even with nicely fast computers,
it can still take a few seconds to read 190 megabytes of data from a
hard disk, and a significant fraction of a second even to read through
it when it's already in memory!
</p><p>

The pi searcher uses half this amount of space.
Note that Pi only contains 10 different
characters (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), unlike completely general
files that can contain 256 different characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z, and
all of the punctuation characters, and then a big set of "unprintable"
characters).  Computers store information as <b>bits</b> - ones and zeros.
Normally, one character is stored as a byte, or 8 bits.  (2^8 = 256, the
number of different characters).  But we only have 10 possibilities, so
the Pi searcher can store those using 4 bits each (2^4 = 16, just a little
more than we need).
</p><p>

So, the solution: The pi searcher stores the digits of Pi packed two
digits per byte.  As a result, the file of Pi is totally unreadable to
a human, but it's half the size of the human-readable version!
</p><p>

If you were counting carefully, you'll have noticed that we use 4 bits
(which can hold 16 values) to store 10 different values.  So there's
actually more room for savings: We technically need only log2 (10) =
3.322 bits to store each number.  Unfortunately, saving that extra .6
bits per digit makes the code a lot more complicated, and slower.
</p>

<h2>Problem 2:  Lots of Comparisons</h2>

<p>
For longer search strings,
strings, the Pi Searcher gets a little bit more clever
and packs the first four digits of the search string
the same way it packs the digits of Pi.  It then goes through and
compares the <i>packed</i> digits.
</p>

<pre>Pi:      14 15 92 65 35 89 79 32 38 46 26 43...
Query:   65 35
         ^^ both checked in one step, because they're just one byte

Pi:      14 15 92 65 35 89 79 32 38 46 26 43...
Query:    6 53 5
          ^^^ still has to do multiple comparisons because they bytes don't line up
</pre>

<p>With this optimization, every other step, the Pi searcher
only has to do one comparison to check two digits, instead of
one comparison per digit.  We also throw in a few little
optimizations (like comparing four digits in a row before
checking to see if any of the comparisons worked) that 
make the linear search faster on a modern CPU.  This happens
because it makes the resulting code have fewer branches
(if-then choices), which can be fairly slow.
</p>

<h3>Why not use a fancy-schmancy-search algorithm?</h3>
<p>When developing the pi searcher, I benchmarked a number of cool, fancy
linear search algorithms that are supposed to be faster than the basic
algorithm.  In general, the linear search I described above - even the
Pi searcher's optimized one - takes time proportional to the number of
digits of Pi <i>and</i> the number of digits in the search string:
Pretend you're comparing two strings: 11110 and 11111.  You compare
the first digits -- match!  So then you compare the second digits, and
the third... and you don't realize that they're different until you
get to the last digit.
</p>
<p>
There are improved search algorithms, such as Boyer-Moore or
Knuth-Morris-Pratt, that require fewer comparisons.  With the Pi
searcher, it turns out that the complexity of the "faster" algorithms
actually makes them slower for searching Pi.  They are, however,
fairly cool algorithms; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_searching_algorithm">Wikipedia's
String searching algorithm entry</a> has more information about them
if you're curious.
</p>

<h2>Problem 3:  Linear Search is slow!</h2>
<p>
All of the optimizations I mentioned above help, but in the
worst case, it still takes a few hundred million comparisons to
figure out whether a string was found, which took about a second or two
on our current hardware.  A second isn't bad, but during the busiest
periods of Pi day, the pi searcher handles about 5 searches every
second.  Clearly, taking one second is way too long.
</p>

<p>
The pi searcher now has a pre-computed index of 
the location of all of the substrings of Pi.  The index is computed
using the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_array">suffix array</a>
code from <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Edoug/sarray/">an implementation by
Sean Quinlan and Sean Dorward</a>.
(Cool trivia:  Suffix arrays were invented in 1990 by Udi Manber,
who subsequently was chief scientist at Yahoo!, then the chief
algorithms officer at Amazon, and who is now at Google.)
 The index takes up 8 times the space
of the compressed digits, but that's only about a gigabyte.
This pre-computed index lets us jump almost immediately to the
place where a particular search string is.
But how can we index every search string, when people could search
for <i>anything</i>?
</p>
<p>
The answer is the beauty of suffix arrays.  Let's say we're indexing the first 10 digits of pi:
</p>

<pre>   1415926535
</pre>

<p>
The suffix array maintains a list in lexicographical order of where 
strings start in pi.  If we look at those 10 digits, we see that
the "smallest" string is the one that starts with "141", and
the next smallest is "159", and then "265", and so on.   So the
suffix array stores the positions at which each of those substrings
begins:  0, 2, 5, 8, 1, 9, 7, 3, 6, 4, which correspond to all possible
substrings of the first ten digits of pi, in increasing order:
</p>
<pre>0:  1415926535
2:  15926535
5:  26535
8:  35
1:  415926535
9:  5
7:  535
3:  5926535
6:  6535
4:  926535
</pre>

<p>
So now, if someone asks for a string starting with "5", we can
look in the index and find it quickly, because the index is
in sorted order.  A technique known as 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search">binary search</a>
does the trick nicely:  We look in the middle of the list.  If the
value at the place we look is <i>larger</i> than what we're
looking for, we know that what we want is in the first half, otherwise
it's in the second half.  And so on, and so on.  It's much like how
you might search through a phone book to find someone's number.
</p>
<h3>But there's a catch</h3>

<p> If you were sharp-eyed, you noticed that there were possibly
<i>many</i> things in the index that match a particular query.  For
instance, if you searched for "5", you would have three possibilities.
To make things worse, the entries in the index are stored in
lexicographical order; the order has nothing to do with <i>where</i>
in Pi the entries occur.  Note how the first "5" in there is actually
the one at the very end!  But the Pi searcher needs to return the
results in order.
</p>
<p>Resolving this isn't too hard:  Once we find the values in the
index, we do a linear search through all of them that match the
search query and take the smallest.  Unfortunately, that could
be a <i>lot</i> of values.  For example, 10\% of the substrings
of Pi begin with the digit "5".  So if someone wants to find the
first 5 in Pi, we might have to scan through twenty million 
entries still.  :(  That's no good.  So this is where we combine
linear search and our index search:
</p>

<ul>
<li>If the search string is 5 digits or smaller, do linear search. With
five digits, we know that this should take around 100,000 digits to
find.</li>
<li>If the search string is six digits or longer, do an index search.
We know that only 1 in 1,000,000 of the substrings will be a false
match to a six digit index search, so we only have to do a linear
search on 200 entries.</li>
</ul>

<p>The observant will note that I didn't split things up optimally. The
best way to do this would be to perform linear search on 4 digit
strings (10,000 comparisons), and then do an index search where you
then have to scan the remaining 2,000 entries, making the maximum
number of comparisons smallest overall. (roughly the square root of the
number of digits). The reason it's unbalanced is because the 5 digit
linear search is really, really optimized, and the linear search in the
index is quite a bit slower. So the time balances out better.
</p>

<h2>The Pi Searcher Server</h2>

<p>
The pi searcher runs on a 1.7Ghz pentium 4 server with 512M of RAM and
a very fast 80GB Seagate SCSI hard drive.  The computer was moderately
nice in 2004, but isn't all that any more.  The Pi Searcher is
hosted by <a href="http://www.xmission.com/">Xmission</a> in their
very cool co-location facility in Salt Lake City, UT.  (Their
fingerprint scanner for door access rocks.)  The server runs an 
older version of FreeBSD and uses the Apache web server.  The
Pi Searcher itself is written in C.
